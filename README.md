# Transcriber-on-Colab
This script uses Whisper, an open source model of OpenAI, and AssemblyAI to transcribe with the most advanced AI-based voice-to-text systems directly on Colab.

## How to use it
Open a new notebook at colab https://colab.research.google.com/ and write the first cell entering the code related to dependencies and run it.

Once you have installed the dependencies create a new cell and enter the contents found inside script.py

With that done you can start the cell containing script.py and take advantage of the wizard interface. 

Note: You will need to have an AssemblyAI API key to use the latter.
